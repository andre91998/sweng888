### Challenges Faced
- I was not familiar with the adapter class, so documentation was consulted to implement that piece of the project

### Improvement Suggestions

- Polish the UI: in both activities, a commercial grade app would have better UI alignment, a consistent and non default theme, as well as solid compatibility for different screen sizes.
- Better UX: besides the UI, the flow is only intuitive after either playing around with the app or knowing beforehand what the app does. For a commercial grade app, that is not acceptable.
