### Improvement Suggestions

- Currently, the age is calculated using only the year, as requested. It would be ideal to use the current month and day to compare against the provided month and day to have a more accurate age.
- As per the specifications, there is a field for first and last name. However, the requirments do not specify that anything be done with these fields. So either they should be removed or something should be done with them to provide a more intuitive experience to the user.
